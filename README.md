## Amazon Connect Integration for Acqueon Engagement Cloud 

Acqueon Engagement Cloud (AEC) is an outbound voice dialer platform that provides real-time lead filtering, segmentation, prioritization, and scheduling. This integration between AEC and Amazon Connect helps significantly improve right party connect (RPC) and agent efficiency to align with your business goals.

This Quick Start configures resources to provide integration between Amazon Connect and AEC in a few easy steps. It requires a subscription to AEC in AWS Marketplace.
